# Cat Clicker

## Project Overview

Cat Clicker is an interactive project developed as part of Udacity's JavaScript Design Patterns course. This application demonstrates the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern using Knockout.js. The application is a fun game where users can click on different cats and track the number of clicks. The project aims to provide practical experience with JavaScript design patterns and frontend development.
